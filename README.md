# V.O. GO

V.O. GO is an app that allows a user to enter upload a recording and some information to a database and perform CRUD on those recordings.

Utilizing SoundCloud's API.

I  was inspired to make this app after reading an online conversation between two Voice Over artists on a Facebook group who didn't like their current recording app. I posted  questions about what functionality and data they'd want to track.
